# Multi-container-host-networking-using-VxLan-overlay-network
Environment setup: At first you have to take two virtual machine and virtual machine should ping one another. I am using centos9 for this demo and I have taken two Centos9 virtual machines from ec2 instances. For Ec2 security group I am allowing all traffic to cope up with connectivity problem. Two virtual machine should be in same vpc so that you can ping one from another.Here is the security group picture
